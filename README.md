# SPOTIFY-.COM
I recently built a Spotify clone using only HTML and CSS, without any frameworks or additional languages. It took me around 7 hours of focused coding, starting at 4 AM and finishing by 11 AM â€” pure dedication and love for front-end development!  This project helped me improve my UI design, layout structuring, and responsive styling skills.
